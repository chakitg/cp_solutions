You are given two positive integers n and limit.

Return the total number of ways to distribute n candies among 3 children such that no child gets more than limit candies.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, limit = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 ways to distribute 5 candies such that no child gets more than 2 candies: (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2) and (2, 2, 1).
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, limit = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 10 ways to distribute 3 candies such that no child gets more than 3 candies: (0, 0, 3), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (0, 3, 0), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0) and (3, 0, 0).
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 106
1 <= limit <= 106



const progression = f = n => n > 0 ? n * (n - 1) / 2 : 0;
const distributeCandies = (n, l) => 
    f(n + 2) + f(n - 2 * l) * 3 - f(n - 3 * l - 1) - f(n - l + 1) * 3;
