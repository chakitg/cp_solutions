Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

 

Example 1:

â€‹
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

n == points.length
2 <= n <= 105
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 109





  class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        vector<int> ans;
        int maxi=0;
        int sndMax=0;
        for(int i=0;i<points.size();i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<points[0].size();j++)
            {
                ans.push_back(points[i][0]);
            }
        }
        sort(ans.begin(),ans.end());
        for(int i=ans.size()-1;i>=1;i--)
        {
            maxi=max(maxi,ans[i]-ans[i-1]);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
