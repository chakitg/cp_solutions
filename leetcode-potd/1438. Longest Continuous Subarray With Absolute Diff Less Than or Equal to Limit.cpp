Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
0 <= limit <= 109



  class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
        multiset<int>s1;
          int i,j=0,n=nums.size(),ans=1;
         
          
          for(i=0;i<n;i++)
          {
            s1.insert(nums[i]);
        
             while(abs(*s1.rbegin()-*s1.begin())>limit)
             {
                s1.erase(s1.find(nums[j]));
                
                j++;
             }
             ans = max(ans, i - j + 1);
          }
          return ans;


    }
};
