Given a Binary Tree. Check for the Sum Tree for every node except the leaf node. Return true if it is a Sum Tree otherwise, return false.

A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as the sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered a Sum Tree.

Examples :

Input:
    3
  /   \    
 1     2
Output: true
Explanation: The sum of left subtree and right subtree is 1 + 2 = 3, which is the value of the root node. Therefore,the given binary tree is a sum tree.
Input:
          10
        /    \
      20      30
    /   \ 
   10    10
Output: false
Explanation: The given tree is not a sum tree. For the root node, sum of elements in left subtree is 40 and sum of elements in right subtree is 30. Root element = 10 which is not equal to 30+40.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree)

Constraints:
2 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node value ≤ 105

            return root->data;

        int sum = solve(root->left) + solve(root->right);

        return sum == root->data ? 2 * sum : -1;
