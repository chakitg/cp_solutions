You are given an integer array arr[] of size n, representing n number of people in a party, each person is denoted by an integer. Couples are represented by the same number ie: two people have the same integer value, it means they are a couple. Find out the only single person in the party of couples.

NOTE: It is guarantee that there exist only one single person in the party.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5
arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
Output: 
3
Explaination: Only the number 3 is single.
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 11 
arr = {1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 6} 
Output: 
4 
Explaination: 4 is the only single.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findSingle() which takes the size of the array n and the array arr[] as input parameters and returns the only single person.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 104
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106




class Solution{
    public:
    int findSingle(int n, int arr[])
    {
        int ans=0;
        for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            ans^=arr[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
