A matrix is constructed of size n*n and given an integer ‘q’. The value at every cell of the matrix is given as, M(i,j) = i+j, where ‘M(i,j)' is the value of a cell, ‘i’ is the row number, and ‘j’ is the column number. Return the number of cells having value ‘q’.

Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.

Examples:

Input: n = 4, q = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Matrix becomes
2 3 4 5 
3 4 5 6 
4 5 6 7
5 6 7 8
The count of 7 is 2.
Input: n = 5, q = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Matrix becomes
2 3 4 5 6 
3 4 5 6 7 
4 5 6 7 8 
5 6 7 8 9 
6 7 8 9 10 
The count of 4 is 3.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:





class Solution {
  public:
    long long sumMatrix(long long n, long long q) {
        // code here
        if(2*n < q){
            return 0ll;
        }
        else if(q<=n){
            return q-1;
        }
        else{
            return 2*n-q+1;
        }
    }
};
