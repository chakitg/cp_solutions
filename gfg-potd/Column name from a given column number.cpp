Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.
Excel columns has a pattern like A, B, C, … ,Z, AA, AB, AC,…. ,AZ, BA, BB, … ZZ, AAA, AAB ….. etc. In other words, column 1 is named as “A”, column 2 as “B”, column 27 as “AA” and so on.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 28
Output: AB
Explanation: 1 to 26 are A to Z.
Then, 27 is AA and 28 = AB.

Example 2:

Input: 
N = 13
Output: M
Explanation: M is the 13th character of
alphabet.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function colName() which takes the column number N as input and returns the column name represented as a string.
Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1018



class Solution {
public:
    string colName(long long int n) {
        string out;
        vector<char> code(26);
        for (int i = 1; i < 26; ++i)
            code[i] = (char)('A' + i - 1);
        code[0] = 'Z';

        while (n) {
            out += code[n % 26];
            if (n % 26 == 0)
                --n;
            n /= 26;
        }

        reverse(out.begin(), out.end());
        return out;
    }
};
