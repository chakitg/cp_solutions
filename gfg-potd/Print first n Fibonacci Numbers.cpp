Given a number N, find the first N Fibonacci numbers. The first two number of the series are 1 and 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 1 2 3 5
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
Output: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
Your Task:
Your task is to complete printFibb() which takes single argument N and returns a list of first N Fibonacci numbers.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Note: This space is used to store and return the answer for printing purpose.

Constraints:
1<= N <=84




class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to return list containing first n fibonacci numbers.
    vector<long long> printFibb(int n) {
        vector<long long> fib(n);
        fib[0] = 1;
        if (n > 1) {
            fib[1] = 1;
            for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
                fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
            }
        }
        return fib;
    }
};
