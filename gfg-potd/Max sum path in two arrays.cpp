Given two sorted arrays of distinct integers arr1 and arr2. Each array may have some elements in common with the other array. Find the maximum sum of a path from the beginning of any array to the end of any array. You can switch from one array to another array only at the common elements.

Note:  When we switch from one array to other,  we need to consider the common element only once in the result.

Examples : 

Input: arr1 = [2, 3, 7, 10, 12] , arr2 = [1, 5, 7, 8]
Output: 35
Explanation: The path will be 1+5+7+10+12 = 35, where 1 and 5 come from arr2 and then 7 is common so we switch to arr1 and add 10 and 12.
Input: arr1 = [1, 2, 3] , arr2[] = [3, 4, 5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The path will be 1+2+3+4+5=15.
Expected Time Complexity: O(m + n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= arr1.size(), arr2.size() <= 104
1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 105

  public:
    int maxPathSum(vector<int> &arr1, vector<int> &arr2) {
        // Code here
      int i=0;
        int j=0;
        int ans=0;
        int sum1=0;
        int sum2=0;
        while(i<arr1.size() && j<arr2.size()){
            if(arr1[i]>arr2[j]){
                sum2+=arr2[j];
                j++;
            }else if(arr1[i]<arr2[j]){
                sum1+=arr1[i];
                i++;
            }else if(arr1[i]==arr2[j]){
                ans+=max(sum1,sum2)+arr1[i];
                sum1=0;
                sum2=0;
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }
        // ans+=max(sum1,sum2);
        while(i<arr1.size()){
            sum1+=arr1[i];
            i++;
        }
        while(j<arr2.size()){
            sum2+=arr2[j];
            j++;
        }
        ans+=max(sum1,sum2);
        return ans;
    }
