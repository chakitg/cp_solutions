Given an array of n positive integers. Find the sum of the maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted in strictly increasing order i.e. a strictly increasing subsequence. 

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 5, arr[] = {1, 101, 2, 3, 100} 
Output: 
106
Explanation:
The maximum sum of a increasing sequence is obtained from {1, 2, 3, 100},
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 4, arr[] = {4, 1, 2, 3}
Output: 
6
Explanation:
The maximum sum of a increasing sequence is obtained from {1, 2, 3}.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function maxSumIS() which takes N and array arr as input parameters and returns the maximum value.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105




class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumIS(int arr[], int n) {
        vector<int> dp(arr, arr + n);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[i]) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[i]);
                }
            }
        }

        int out = 0;
        for (auto i : dp) {
            out = max(out, i);
        }
        return out;
    }
};
