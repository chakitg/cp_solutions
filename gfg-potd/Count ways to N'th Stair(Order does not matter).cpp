There are n stairs, and a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does not matter).
Note: Order does not matter means for n = 4:- {1 2 1},{2 1 1},{1 1 2} are considered same.

Examples :

Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Three ways to reach at 4th stair. They are {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}.
Input: n = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Three ways to reach at 5th stair. They are {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2, 1} and {1, 2, 2}.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 104

	public:
		int nthStair(int n){
            int dp[n+1]={0};
            dp[0] = 1;
            dp[1] = 1;
            for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 1;
            return dp[n];
		}
