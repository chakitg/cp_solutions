Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points in a move. Given a total score n, find number of distinct combinations to reach the given score.

Example 1:

Input
n = 10
Output
2
Explanation
There are two ways {5,5} and {10}.
Example 2:

Input
n = 20
Output
4
Explanation
There are four possible ways. {5,5,5,5}, {3,3,3,3,3,5}, {10,10}, {5,5,10}.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count( ) which takes n as input parameter and returns the answer to the problem.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 106
class Solution {
public:
    long long int count(long long int n)
    {
        vector<long long int> dp(n+1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i] += dp[i - 3];
        for (int i = 5; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i] += dp[i - 5];
        for (int i = 10; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i] += dp[i - 10];

        return dp[n];
    }
};
