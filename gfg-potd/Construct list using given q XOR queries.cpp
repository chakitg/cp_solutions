Given a list s that initially contains only a single value 0. There will be q queries of the following types:

0 x: Insert x in the list
1 x: For every element a in s, replace it with a ^ x. ('^' denotes the bitwise XOR operator)
Return the sorted list after performing the given q queries.

Example 1:

Input:
q = 5
queries[] = {{0, 6}, {0, 3}, {0, 2}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}}
Output:
1 2 3 7
Explanation:
[0] (initial value)
[0 6] (add 6 to list)
[0 6 3] (add 3 to list)
[0 6 3 2] (add 2 to list)
[4 2 7 6] (XOR each element by 4)
[1 7 2 3] (XOR each element by 5)
The sorted list after performing all the queries is [1 2 3 7]. 
Example 2:
Input:
q = 3
queries[] = {{0, 2}, {1, 3}, {0, 5}} 
Output :
1 3 5
Explanation:
[0] (initial value)
[0 2] (add 2 to list)
[3 1] (XOR each element by 3)
[3 1 5] (add 5 to list)
The sorted list after performing all the queries is [1 3 5].

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function constructList() which takes an integer q the number of queries and queries[] a list of lists of length 2 denoting the queries as input parameters and returns the final constructed list.


Expected Time Complexity: O(q*log(q))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(l), where l is only used for output-specific requirements.


Constraints:
1 ≤ q ≤ 105






class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> constructList(int q, vector<vector<int>> &queries) {
        // code here
        vector<int> s = {0};
        int cumulativeXOR = 0;

        for (const auto &query : queries) {
            int type = query[0];
            int x = query[1];

            if (type == 0) {
                s.push_back(x ^ cumulativeXOR);
            } else if (type == 1) {
                cumulativeXOR ^= x;
            }
        }

        for (int &num : s) {
            num ^= cumulativeXOR;
        }

        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        return s;
    }
};
