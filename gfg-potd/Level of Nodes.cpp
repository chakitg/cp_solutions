Given an integer X and an undirected acyclic graph with V nodes, labeled from 0 to V-1, and E edges, find the level of node labeled as X.

Level is the minimum number of edges you must travel from the node 0 to some target.

If there doesn't exists such a node that is labeled as X, return -1.

Example 1:

Input:

X = 4
Output:
2
Explanation:

We can clearly see that Node 4 lies at Level 2.
Example 2:

Input:

X = 1
Output:
1
Explanation:
Node 1 lies at level 1, immediate after Node 0.
Your task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function nodeLevel() which takes two integers V and X denoting the number of vertices and the node, and another adjacency list adj as input parameters and returns the level of Node X. If node X isn't present it returns -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(V)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V)

Constraints:
2 ≤ V ≤ 104
1 ≤ E ≤ 104
0 ≤ adji, j < V
1 ≤ X < V
Graph doesn't contain multiple edges and self loops.




class Solution
{
	public:
	int nodeLevel(int V, vector<int> adj[], int X) 
	{
	    vector<bool> visited(V, false);
        vector<int> level(V, 0);

        queue<int> q;
        q.push(0);
        visited[0] = true;

        while (!q.empty())
        {
            int current = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int neighbor : adj[current])
            {
                if (!visited[neighbor])
                {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    level[neighbor] = level[current] + 1;
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        if (visited[X])
            return level[X];
        else
            return -1;
	}
};
