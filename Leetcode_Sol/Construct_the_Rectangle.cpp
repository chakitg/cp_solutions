// A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

// The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
// The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
// The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
// Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: area = 4
// Output: [2,2]
// Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
// But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
// Example 2:

// Input: area = 37
// Output: [37,1]
// Example 3:

// Input: area = 122122
// Output: [427,286]
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= area <= 107

            ans[0] = area/i, ans[1] = i;
